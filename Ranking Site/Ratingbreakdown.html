        <p1>Rating this many different things can lead to unconsistant results. Which is why I decided to give each category it's own dedicated ranking system. I will strive to explain each categorys ranking system as in depth as possible.</p1>

    <div class="outer-box">Anime
        <div class="inner-box">When rating anime there are multiple things I factor in:<br>
      <table id="tblRatings">
            <tr>
                <th>Animation</th>
                <th>Characters</th>
                <th>Story</th>
            </tr>

        <script src="jsforrating.js"></script>
        </table>
If an anime is new I will look back in 2 months to see if recency bias was in affect.</div>
